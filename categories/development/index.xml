<p>Apache Kafka is an open-source streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is a distributed and fault-tolerant message broker that enables communication between producers, consumers, and other applications. In this guide, we will discuss the basics of Kafka and how to get started with it.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before getting started, you should have a basic understanding of the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed systems</li>
<li>Message brokers</li>
<li>Streaming applications</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also have a working knowledge of Java, as Kafka is written in Java.</p>
<h2 id="installing-apache-kafka">Installing Apache Kafka</h2>
<p>The first step is to install Apache Kafka on your system. You can download the latest version of Kafka from the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads">Apache Kafka website</a>. Once you have downloaded the package, you can extract it and run the following command to start the server:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-topic">Creating a Topic</h2>
<p>Once the server is up and running, we can create a new topic. To do this, run the following command:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-topics.sh &ndash;create &ndash;zookeeper localhost:2181 &ndash;replication-factor 1 &ndash;partitions 1 &ndash;topic my-topic</p>
<p>This will create a new topic called <code>my-topic</code> with a single partition and one replica.</p>
<h2 id="producing-and-consuming-messages">Producing and Consuming Messages</h2>
<p>Now that we have a topic, we can start producing and consuming messages. To produce messages, we can use the <code>kafka-console-producer.sh</code> script. This script allows us to send messages to the topic we created. For example, to send a message to <code>my-topic</code>, we can run the following command:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-console-producer.sh &ndash;broker-list localhost:9092 &ndash;topic my-topic</p>
<p>We can then type in our messages and press enter to send them.</p>
<p>To consume messages, we can use the <code>kafka-console-consumer.sh</code> script. This script allows us to read messages from the topic we created. For example, to read messages from <code>my-topic</code>, we can run the following command:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh &ndash;bootstrap-server localhost:9092 &ndash;topic my-topic &ndash;from-beginning</p>
<p>This will read all the messages from the beginning of the topic.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this guide, we discussed the basics of Apache Kafka and how to get started with it. We also discussed how to install it, create a topic, and produce and consume messages.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grpc">What is gRPC?</h2>
<p>gRPC is a high-performance, lightweight communication framework designed for making traditional RPC calls, or in other words, procedure calls over the network between client and server applications. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or non-blocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-grpc-server">Setting Up a gRPC Server</h2>
<p>To set up a gRPC server, you need to define the service interface in a .proto file. This file contains the methods that the server can call, along with the parameters and return types. The .proto file is then compiled into code that is used to generate the server and client stubs.</p>
<p>Once the .proto file is ready, the server needs to be implemented. This involves writing the code for each of the methods defined in the .proto file. The server code should handle incoming requests, perform the necessary processing, and return the response back to the client.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-grpc-client">Setting Up a gRPC Client</h2>
<p>Once the server is up and running, the client can be set up. The client code should be able to call the methods defined in the .proto file, and handle the response. The client code should also be able to handle errors and timeouts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>gRPC is an efficient, modern communication framework that can be used to build connected systems. To get started with gRPC, you need to define the service interface in a .proto file, implement the server code, and set up the client code.</p>
