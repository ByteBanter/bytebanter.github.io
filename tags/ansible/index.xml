It is an open-source platform that is easy to use and provides a wide range of features. In this article, we will discuss how to get started with Ansible.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Before getting started with Ansible, there are a few prerequisites that need to be met. First, you will need to have an operating system that is supported by Ansible. Currently, this includes Linux, macOS, and Windows. Additionally, you will need to have Python installed on your system.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>Once you have the prerequisites set up, you can move on to installing Ansible. To do this, you can use your operating system&rsquo;s package manager. On most Linux distributions, this will be <code>apt</code>, <code>yum</code>, or <code>dnf</code>. For macOS, you can use <code>brew</code> or <code>port</code>. Lastly, for Windows, you can use <code>chocolatey</code>.</p>
<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>Once you have Ansible installed, you will need to configure it. This can be done by creating an <code>ansible.cfg</code> file in the root of your project. This file should contain the following configuration options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>host_key_checking</code> - This option should be set to <code>False</code> to disable host key checking.</li>
<li><code>inventory</code> - This option should be set to the path of your inventory file.</li>
<li><code>remote_user</code> - This option should be set to the username that Ansible will use to connect to remote hosts.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="writing-playbooks">Writing Playbooks</h1>
<p>Now that Ansible is installed and configured, you can start writing playbooks. Playbooks are written in YAML and contain instructions for Ansible to execute. They can be used to configure systems, deploy applications, and much more.</p>
<h1 id="running-playbooks">Running Playbooks</h1>
<p>Once you have written your playbook, you can run it using the <code>ansible-playbook</code> command. This command will execute the instructions in the playbook and apply the changes to the target system.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this article, we discussed how to get started with Ansible. We looked at the prerequisites, installation, configuration, and writing playbooks. Finally, we discussed how to run playbooks.</p>
