It is a distributed and fault-tolerant message broker that enables communication between producers, consumers, and other applications. In this guide, we will discuss the basics of Kafka and how to get started with it.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Before getting started, you should have a basic understanding of the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed systems</li>
<li>Message brokers</li>
<li>Streaming applications</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also have a working knowledge of Java, as Kafka is written in Java.</p>
<h1 id="installing-apache-kafka">Installing Apache Kafka</h1>
<p>The first step is to install Apache Kafka on your system. You can download the latest version of Kafka from the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads">Apache Kafka website</a>. Once you have downloaded the package, you can extract it and run the following command to start the server:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties</p>
<h1 id="creating-a-topic">Creating a Topic</h1>
<p>Once the server is up and running, we can create a new topic. To do this, run the following command:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-topics.sh &ndash;create &ndash;zookeeper localhost:2181 &ndash;replication-factor 1 &ndash;partitions 1 &ndash;topic my-topic</p>
<p>This will create a new topic called <code>my-topic</code> with a single partition and one replica.</p>
<h1 id="producing-and-consuming-messages">Producing and Consuming Messages</h1>
<p>Now that we have a topic, we can start producing and consuming messages. To produce messages, we can use the <code>kafka-console-producer.sh</code> script. This script allows us to send messages to the topic we created. For example, to send a message to <code>my-topic</code>, we can run the following command:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-console-producer.sh &ndash;broker-list localhost:9092 &ndash;topic my-topic</p>
<p>We can then type in our messages and press enter to send them.</p>
<p>To consume messages, we can use the <code>kafka-console-consumer.sh</code> script. This script allows us to read messages from the topic we created. For example, to read messages from <code>my-topic</code>, we can run the following command:</p>
<p>bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh &ndash;bootstrap-server localhost:9092 &ndash;topic my-topic &ndash;from-beginning</p>
<p>This will read all the messages from the beginning of the topic.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this guide, we discussed the basics of Apache Kafka and how to get started with it. We also discussed how to install it, create a topic, and produce and consume messages.</p>
